# Hull Tactical Competition

This repository provides a full pipeline for the Hull Tactical systematic trading competition:
1. Model to predict daily forward excess returns.
2. Allocation sizing, backtesting, and final submission generation.

## Competition Overview

The Hull Tactical competition evaluates daily allocation strategies on the U.S. equity market.

Participants submit a daily allocation in the range `[0, 2]`:

| Allocation | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 0.0       | Fully underweight |
| 1.0       | Market neutral |
| 2.0       | Maximum overweight |

The strategy’s annualized volatility must remain at or below `1.2×` the volatility of the benchmark index.

Evaluation occurs in two phases:
- Historical backtest scoring
- Live forward scoring after submissions close

The objective is to produce stable, interpretable allocation signals.


## About This Project

Developed by **Alvaro Balbin** and **Aung Kaung**.

Focus:
- Deterministic ML pipeline
- Volatility-normalized signal sizing
- Smooth allocation transitions to reduce turnover
- Direct submission-ready output

The project was built quickly and intentionally with minimal unnecessary complexity.


## Setup

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Expected input data:
    data/train.csv
    data/test.csv


## Part 1 - Model Training and Prediction

Train the model:
    
    python -m src.train

Generate predictions:
    
    python -m src.predict

This produces:
    
    outputs/predictions.parquet


## Part 2 - Backtesting

Run backtest:
    
    python -m src.backtest \
      --train data/train.csv \
      --preds outputs/predictions.parquet \
      --out outputs

Outputs:
    
    outputs/backtest_daily.csv
    outputs/metrics.json
    outputs/plots/


## Part 3 - Submission Generation

Generate final submission file:
    
    python -m src.submit_cli \
      --train data/train.csv \
      --test data/test.csv \
      --preds_test outputs/predictions.parquet \
      --out outputs/submission.csv

Final output format:
    
    date_id,allocation
    8980,1.250000
    8981,1.500000
    ...

Allocations are continuous values in `[0, 2]` due to the volatility-normalized sigmoid sizing rule.


## Requirements to Satisfy

- Allocation values must remain in `[0, 2]`.
- Strategy volatility must be ≤ `1.2×` benchmark volatility.
- Final submission file must be:
    
      outputs/submission.csv
