# Hull Tactical Competition

This pipeline trains a predictive model for daily market excess returns, converts predictions into portfolio allocations under volatility constraints, and produces a final submission file for the Hull Tactical competition.

This repository contains two parts:
1. Model to predict daily forward excess returns.
2. Allocation mapping, backtesting, and final submission generation.


## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements:
```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
pyarrow
```

Input data:
```
data/train.csv
data/test.csv
```


## Part 1: Model (Training + Prediction)

Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

Generate predictions:
```bash
python predict.py
```

This should produce:
```
data/pred_train.parquet
data/preds_test.parquet
```


## Part 2: Backtesting and Submission

Run backtest:
```bash
python backtest.py
```

Generate submission file:
```bash
python submit.py
```

Final output format:
```
outputs/submission.csv
date_id,allocation
...
```


## Requirements to Satisfy

- Allocation values must remain within `[0, 2]`.
- Portfolio volatility must not exceed `1.2x` benchmark volatility.
- Submit `outputs/submission.csv` for evaluation.
