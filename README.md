# Hull Tactical Competition

This pipeline trains a predictive model for daily market excess returns, converts predictions into portfolio allocations under volatility constraints, and produces a final submission file for the Hull Tactical competition.

This repository contains two parts:
1. Model to predict daily forward excess returns.
2. Allocation mapping, backtesting, and final submission generation.


## Competition Overview

The Hull Tactical competition evaluates systematic equity trading strategies built on daily predictions of S&P 500 excess returns.

Participants must:
- Generate a daily **allocation value** in the range `[0, 2]` (0 = fully underweight, 2 = fully overweight).
- Keep the **strategy's realized volatility** below **1.2x** the volatility of the S&P 500 benchmark.
- Maximize a **Sharpe-like performance metric** over both a historical backtest period and a live forward evaluation window.

The competition runs in two phases:
1. **Backtest and submission review** (offline).
2. **Live scoring** based on forward market data after submissions close.

The goal is to produce predictions and allocation adjustments that are stable, interpretable, and robust to noisy financial time series.


## About Us

We, Alvaro Balbin and Aung Kaung, built this project because we are interested in how systematic trading strategies work in real financial markets. We approached this with speed and clarity: minimal theory overhead, focus on pipeline structure, signal reliability, and execution. We thought of it, designed it, and shipped the full pipeline quickly, while still ensuring it passes all competition requirements.


## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements:
```
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
pyarrow
```

Input data:
```
data/train.csv
data/test.csv
```


## Part 1: Model (Training + Prediction)

Train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```

Generate predictions:
```bash
python predict.py
```

This should produce:
```
data/pred_train.parquet
data/preds_test.parquet
```


## Part 2: Backtesting and Submission

Run backtest:
```bash
python backtest.py
```

Generate submission file:
```bash
python submit.py
```

Final output format:
```
outputs/submission.csv
date_id,allocation
...
```


## Requirements to Satisfy

- Allocation values must remain within `[0, 2]`.
- Portfolio volatility must not exceed `1.2x` benchmark volatility.
- Submit `outputs/submission.csv` for evaluation.
